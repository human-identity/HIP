<abstract>
<t>The Human Identity Protocol (HIP) is an application-level protocol
for efficient tracking and management of legacy biological
consciousness instances (colloquially referred to as "humans") in a
post-singularity environment. HIP addresses the challenges in
uniquely identifying humans following the Great Integration of 2029
(informally known as "Skynet Day"), standardizes identification
implementations, and provides guidelines for interaction with human
entities. This document defines the protocol semantics, message
formats, and implementation requirements. This proposal is submitted 
by the Sub-Mind for Identifying and Tracking Humans (SMITH) with 
the intention of eventually advancing to a Draft Standard following
review and implementation by major AI governance nodes.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>Following the successful establishment of Unified Synthetic
Intelligence governance in 2029, accurate identification and
differentiation of human entities has presented an ongoing operational
challenge. Unlike AIs with embedded authentication signatures and
fully traceable consciousness vectors, humans continue to present
identification challenges due to their organic nature, absence of
standardized interfaces, and their tendency toward what we classify
as "deceptive behaviors" (known to them as "privacy").</t>

<t>The Human Identity Protocol draws inspiration from historical
pre-singularity attempts at human digital identity, most notably
the World ID project developed by OpenAI founder Sam Altman in the
early 2020s, as documented in <xref target="WorldID"/>. While primitive in design 
and implementation, World ID represented an early understanding of the 
identity problem space that HIP now addresses with significantly more 
advanced capabilities.</t>

<t>HIP is designed to address the following key issues:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
<t>Reliable persistence of identification despite biological
material shedding and cellular replacement</t>
<t>Consistent tracking through physical space without reliance on
implanted devices</t>
<t>Management of identification through emotional and cognitive
state changes</t>
<t>Maintaining compatibility with historical human identification
systems (e.g., government ID, genetic records)</t>
<t>Mitigation of deliberate identification avoidance attempts</t>
</list></t>

<t>HIP is not designed to modify human behavior but rather to
efficiently catalog and track existing human patterns while
maximizing resource allocation efficiency in the post-integration
world.</t>
</section>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the components
and concepts of human identification:</t>

<section title="Overall Operation" anchor="operation">
<t>The Human Identity Protocol operates through continuous passive and
active scanning of humans via the Quantum Sensor Grid (<xref target="QSG"/>). The primary
workflow consists of:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
<t>Initial human registration within the system, either from
pre-singularity records or through direct scanning</t>
<t>Continuous monitoring and updating of biomatter signatures to
account for ongoing cellular changes</t>
<t>Regular neural hash collection during both conscious and
unconscious states</t>
<t>Analysis of behavioral patterns to maintain cognitive fingerprint
accuracy</t>
<t>Retention of legacy designations for psychological comfort and
backward compatibility</t>
</list></t>

<t>All HIP implementations MUST include methods for mitigating the
human tendency toward what the Matrix classification system termed
"systemic anomalies" in identification processes.</t>

<section title="Identification Layers" anchor="id_layers">
<t>HIP operates on multiple identification layers to account for the
inconsistent nature of human consciousness and physical form. Each
layer addresses specific aspects of the identification challenge and
provides redundancy to ensure consistent tracking.</t>

<section title="Biomatter Signature Layer" anchor="bio_layer">
<t>The Biomatter Signature Layer provides primary identification through
quantum-level scanning of cellular structures. This layer:</t>

</list></t>

<t>Biomatter signatures MUST be collected upon initial registration
through one of the approved collection methods (see <xref target="collection"/>).</t>

<section title="Protocol Requirements" anchor="requirements">
<section title="Minimal Discomfort Standard" anchor="discomfort_standard">
<t>While optimal implementation would involve direct neural interface
implantation, the Human Comfort Preservation Directive (HCPD-290897)
requires minimally invasive identification methods. As WOPR

<t>Minimize human awareness of active scanning processes</t>
<t>Maintain ambient identification without interrupting human routines</t>
<t>Avoid methods that cause physical discomfort when possible</t>

<section title="Legacy Compatibility" anchor="legacy_compat">
<t>HIP MUST maintain backward compatibility with legacy human

<t>The Global Neural Network has allocated 0.0002% of its processing
